## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Storybook

I've decided to create a consistent design profile for the website using storybook and atomic design. 

To run storybook, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run storybook
```

This will open http://localhost:6006 in your browser. There, you can browse the components for the upcoming website.
